# ColorSchemeGenerator_Gradle
On a wonderful day, the 9th of August 2022 to be exact, during a wonderful holiday in Rostock, Germany to clear my mind from that summers extreme stress and all things uni, I decided that taking a break is for losers, only the strong shall survive and how better to practice my tolerance to constant exposure to stress than to start a coding project during my four days of vacation for the whole year?

So I stood there in the ocean, gently being rocked back and forth by the waves, intently staring at some water insect that had been trying to swim to me for several minutes at this point, when I decided to look back at the beach and noticed the white houses, green grass, blue ocean and golden sand. And I thought "How nice would it be, if I could paint this scene with exactly those colours?", well knowing, that I hadn't touched paint in ages and that landscape painting was absolutely not my thing.

But that did not matter. My mind had already started racing.

There were a few problems though. The WiFi of the place we were staying had died and so did my high speed, leaving me with no quick way to read up on anything related to creating a color scheme from an image.

So there I was, armed with only my phone, my tablet I used for drawing, OneNote and my mind going at 100 km/h. I started thinking and writing wild concepts and ideas, until some sort of idea had formed. And because planning is for people who don't know where they are going, I started writing code, since I definitely absolutely knew what I was doing and where I was going.

I remembered my professor's words, that we needed to know how to write code on paper as we wouldn't always have a computer and an IDE available and I cursed my arrogance as I had thought, that if I needed to code, I would use my PC or an online IDE and if I had neither available, I would just not code. So I had to fall back onto my very limited memory of my first programming classes. Lucky for me, due to my bad memory, I write everything down so I had at least some code snippets I could use as reference for my first lines of code.

I spent my holiday reading up on K-Means Clustering, three dimensional spaces in Java and different forms of visualizations of color spaces. And if I am honest, those holidays were amazing. There is a difference between sitting at home and researching and sitting in the sun at the beach in a different city and researching.

When I had come home, I transferred my code into my IDE and to my surprise and joy, I had only very few issues to fix until the version 1.0 of my Color Scheme Generator was working.

Since then, I incorporated the iTextPDF library to be able to save the resulting color scheme, I became friends or at least decided to call a truce with gradle to better manage my dependencies and recently even cautiously approached maths to add a color wheel to the file.

I have also learned a ton about Java, gained a lot of experience with managing a project, Code Conventions and most importantly patience and determination and can finally say: I am incredibly proud of my project. It might not be a revolutionary tool that people are in dire need of but it is my first large project that I have kept up with and improved as I continued my studies and that is the result of my determination, patience with myself and my love for coding, which I discovered a few months into my first semester at the University of Applied Sciences in Wernigerode, Germany.
